metric_id	description
fragments_total	 number of unique ATAC fragments in cluster
cell_count	 number of cells in cluster
n_enh_elements	 number of unique non-promoter elements linked to at least one gene in thresholded predictions
n_genes_with_enh	 number of genes with at least one non-promoter enhancer in thresholded predictions
n_enh_gene_links	 number of enhancer-gene links, not including promoters linked to any gene, in thresholded predictions
mean_genes_per_enh	 average number of genes linked to each (non-promoter) enhancer in thresholded predictions
mean_enh_per_gene	 average number of non-promoter enhancers for each gene with at least one non-promoter enhancer in thresholded predictions
mean_dist_to_tss	 average distance, in base pairs, between midpoint of enhancer and transcription start site across enhancer-gene links (no promoter elements) in thresholded predictions
mean_enh_width	 mean width, in base pairs, of unique non-promoter enhancer elements in thresholded predictions
n_genes_active_promoter	 number of genes considered for candidate element-gene pairs based on promoter accessibility
n_genes_not_expressed	 number of genes excluded from predictions due to TPM being below designated threshold (applies to scE2G_Multiome only)
