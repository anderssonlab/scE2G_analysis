metric_id	description
num_unique_fragments	 number of unique ATAC fragments in cluster
num_cells	 number of cells in cluster
num_enh	 number of unique non-promoter elements linked to at least one gene in thresholded predictions
num_genes_with_enh	 number of genes with at least one non-promoter enhancer in thresholded predictions
num_enh_gene_links	 number of enhancer-gene links, not including promoters linked to any gene, in thresholded predictions
mean_num_genes_per_enh	 average number of genes linked to each (non-promoter) enhancer in thresholded predictions
mean_num_enh_per_gene	 average number of non-promoter enhancers for each gene with at least one non-promoter enhancer in thresholded predictions
mean_log10_dist_to_tss	 average log10 distance, in base pairs, between midpoint of enhancer and transcription start site across enhancer-gene links (no promoter elements) in thresholded predictions
