column_name	description
chr	chromosome for element-gene pair
start	start coordinate for element (hg38)
end	end coordinate for element (hg38)
name	unique identified for element, in the form of "class|chrN:start-end"
class	category describing element location, one of: "promoter," "intergenic," "genic"
TargetGene	HGNC symbol for target gene of element-gene pair
TargetGeneTSS	transcription start site of target gene
TargetGeneIsExpressed	boolean indicating whether the target gene is expressed based on promoter accessibility, should be "True" for all predictions 
TargetGeneEnsembl_ID	Ensembl ID corresponding to target gene
isSelfPromoter	boolean indicating whether this element-gene pair is a promoter linked to it's own gene
CellType	description of cell cluster for these predictions
distance	distance between the midpoint of element and transcription start site of target gene
normalizedATAC_prom	(model feature) normalized pseudobulk scATAC-seq signal at the promoter of the target gene
ABC.Score	(model feature for scE2G_ATAC) Activity-by-Contact (ABC) score corresponding to this element-gene pair, calculated using pseudobulk scATAC-seq  for activity and a distance-based power law estimation for contact
numCandidateEnhGene	(model feature) number of elements between this element and target gene transcription start site
numTSSEnhGene	(model feature) number of other transcription start sites between this element and the target ene transcription start site
numNearbyEnhancers	(model feature) number of elements within 5 kb of this element
ubiqExpressed	(model feature) boolean indicating whether this gene is classified as ubiquitously expressed across cell types
RNA_meanLogNorm	mean log-normalized read count for this gene in this cell cluster (scE2G_Multiome only)
RNA_pseudobulkTPM	pseudobulk transcripts per million for this target gene for this cell cluster (scE2G_Multiome only)
RNA_percentCellsDetected	percent of cells in this cell cluster in which this gene was detected (scE2G_Multiome only)
Kendall	Kendall correlation between accessibility at this element and expression of this gene across cells in this cluster (scE2G_Multiome only)
ARC.E2G.Score	(model feature for scE2G_Multiome) Activity, Responsiveness and Contact (ARC)-E2G score that integrates ABC score and Kendall correlation  (scE2G_Multiome only)
E2G.Score	raw scE2G score directly output from logistic regression model
E2G.Score.qnorm	final scE2G score after quantile normalization to full-depth reference scores and, for scE2G_Multiome, setting scores for genes below TPM threshold to 0; score column used for thresholding
E2G.Score.qnorm.ignoreTPM	same as E2G.Score.qnorm, but without scores for genes with TPM below threshold set to 0 (scE2G_Multiome only)
